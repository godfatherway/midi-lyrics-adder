Put me on
the first flight
Take me
to wher-e-ver
Su-n-ny days
or cold nights
It don't mat-ter
the wea-ther
What could
be bet-ter
When pa-ra-dise
feels so right
with-out you
M-m-m
My u-ni-verse
kind-a works
it's true
M-m-m
I'm so glad
to know you
Won't be here
to fxck
with my mood
No bxll-shxt
to ar-gue
I don't hold
a thing
a-gainst yo-u
I'm so grate-ful
Eve-ry day
I'm smi-lin'
way mo-re
I'm so hap-py
you're not here
[0]Thought that
lov-in' you
would make me
feel lo-ved
When all
it e-ver did
was fx-ck me up
But it's o-ver now
I can't stand you
And I can't
b-e-lieve
all th-e time
I would
waste with you
You'd call me up
we'd fxck make up
But I could-n't
see it back the-n
That lov-in' you
is just a
phase man
And I-~-I0]
I'm so glad
to know you
Won't be here
to fxck
with my mood
No bxll-shxt
to ar-gue
I don't hold
a thing
a-gainst yo-u
I'm so grate-ful
Eve-ry day
I'm smil-in'
way mo-re
I'm so hap-py
you're not here
I'm hav-in'
the best ti-me
With you not
by m-y side
Would you ra-ther
me fxck-xn' li-e
Just don't act
so sur-prised
If I sa-y too much
whe-n you call me
Plea-se shut up
I'm real-ly
not so-r-ry
At lea-st
it's sin-cere
I'm so blessed
that you're
not he-re
So I-~-I
I'm so glad
to know you
Won't be here
to fxck
with my mood
No bxll-shxt
to ar-gue
I don't hold
a thing
ag-ainst yo-u
I'm so grate-ful
Eve-ry day
I'm smil-in'

I'm so hap-py
